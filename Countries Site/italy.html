				   <p>Venice is a city located in the middle of a lagoon in northeast Italy. Venice was established in 421 making it over 1,200 years old. Venice became a part of Italy in 1966 where before it was its own 
				   independent republic.  Venice is an urbanized city that is built on a collection of small islands, 116 islands to be exact. Most of the buildings in Venice are at least a couple of centuries old. Since 
				   the city is a bunch of islands connected, a method of transportation that they are known for is boats down canals. In total there are 182 canals and 435 bridges across those canals. Venice is also 
				   known for their churches where there are 139 of them. One of the most popular tourist attractions in Venice is St. Mark's Basilica (pictured below) which is Venice's most famous church. Another popular location is St. 
				   Mark's square which is a big open area surrounded on three sides by some of the best architecture in the city and is where the Basilica is located.</p>

			   <p>Rome is a city located on the western cost of Italy on the Tiber River. Rome was founded in 753 B.C making it over 2,500 years old. The first 1000 years of 
			   existence was the Roman Empire period which is a bit too much to cover here. Rome became part of Italy in 1870 where it was chosen to be the capital. The city of Rome is full of amazing architecture from 
			   the 4th century and earlier which is how why the buildings there are designed the way they are. One of the most well-known places in Rome is the Roman Colosseum (pictured below) which is a large amphitheater that held 65,000 people in the days of the Roman Empire. This is where spectators
			   watched gladiators battle each other and wild animals to the death.</p>
